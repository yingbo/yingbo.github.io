The reverse tunnel is a good example and a very useful one. It answers the question: if a user can ssh from a server A to a server B, can the user ssh back from B to A, even A is behind a router? In my case, it is very helpful. I have a desktop in the office, but the office VPN has not been set up yet. How can I ssh to my office desktop from home? The answer is SSH reverse tunnel, using a server with a public IP as a jumper. Followings show how did I do it. As a start, we need to ssh from the server A (office desktop) to server B (the server with a public IP). It has more parameters than common SSH, to enable reverse tunnel: ssh -R 19999:localhost:22 my_username_on_server_b@serer_b{lang=”bash”} The port 22 is the office desktop ssh server port. The standard is 22, valid for most of cases. The 19999 is going to be used to ssh port on server B. Next I ‘ll show how do I ssh back from the server B to my desktop. It’s pretty simple: ssh -p 19999 my_username_on_server_a@serer_b{lang=”bash”} Note how do we use the port 19999. Another important thing is this time we use my_username_on_server_a. In many cases a user uses a same user name on both servers, however, mine are different. After that I already jump to my office desktop . However, it is possible that the ssh connection from the first step gone. How can I fix it while I am at home? At first I thought I needed a cron job to keep reconnecting, till I found the autossh. The usage is very simple: autossh -M 19990 -f -N -o &quot;PubkeyAuthentication=yes&quot; -o &quot;PasswordAuthentication=no&quot; -R 19999:localhost:22 my_username_on_server_b@serer_b{lang=”bash”} Now I have a stable connection. Unless the office has a power off, I am pretty safe now.","link":"/2015/ssh-reverse-tunnel"},{"title":"A Better Feature Branch Naming in Intellij IDEA","text":"Intellij Idea has a very nice feature: you can customize feature branch name. When create a new task, the Intellij IDEA will help you create a new (git) branch. The default name of the branch is the task number, e.g. FOO-1 for Jira, or #1 for gitlab. However, we can make the branch name better by adding the task summary to it. It will be like FOO-1-add-a-new-feature. To configure it, goes to Preferences-&gt;Tools-&gt;Task and change the Feature branch name format to {id}-{summary}","link":"/2016/a-better-feature-branch-naming-in-intellij-idea"},{"title":"Generate Random Numbers from Command Line","text":"On mac or bsd, we can use jot. jot -r 1 0 10000 or jot -r 1 0 0x7fffffffffffffffL On linux need to install the package athena-jot: sudo apt-get install athena-jot","link":"/2016/generate-random-numbers-from-command-line"}],"tags":[{"name":"docker","slug":"docker","link":"/tags/docker/"},{"name":"dev","slug":"dev","link":"/tags/dev/"},{"name":"ssh","slug":"ssh","link":"/tags/ssh/"},{"name":"network","slug":"network","link":"/tags/network/"},{"name":"dev-tools","slug":"dev-tools","link":"/tags/dev-tools/"}],"categories":[{"name":"Dev","slug":"Dev","link":"/categories/Dev/"},{"name":"Network","slug":"Network","link":"/categories/Network/"}]}
